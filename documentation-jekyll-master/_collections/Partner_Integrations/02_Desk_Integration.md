# Desk Integration

Follow the instructions on this page to get started with your Desk integration.

## Linking Appboy to Desk

__Note:__ These instructions assume that you have already created a Desk account. If you have not, follow the instructions [here][3].

#### Step 1:

Navigate to the '3rd Party Integrations' page on the Appboy Dashboard under the 'APP SETTINGS' section and click the 'Feedback' tab.

#### Step 2:

On the Feedback Integration page, input your Desk URL, email address and Desk password in the designated fields as shown below.

## Integration Complete

Desk should now be integrated into your Appboy account. To confirm a successful integration you should see new user feeback data tracked as cases in your Desk Inbox.

### Sync Direction

Currently, Appboy only supports single-way case creation through Desk. This mean that comments or changes to Desk changes will __not__ be reflected on the Appboy feedback page.

### What Appboy Sends to Desk

Once Desk is fully integrated into your Appboy dashboard, your Desk account will automatically receive any user-submitted feedback/issues that are sent __after__ that point. This means that pre-existing issues must be entered into your Desk dashboard manually.
