## Localization

Localization is supported within the Appboy Android SDK. In addition to English, Appboy supports 29 languages in our built-in SDK messages. These pertain to the default messages displayed in applications integrated with Appboy, such as places in the app that request feedback ("Please enter a feedback message") or when there are connectivity issues ("Cannot establish network connection. Please try again later.") See below for a full list of messages (strings). If the phone language is set to one of the supported languages, any of the Appboy default strings triggered within an integrated application will automatically appear in that language.
