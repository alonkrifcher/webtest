# Multi-Channel Messaging

When it comes to mobile marketing, there is no one channel that is most effective for targeting all users. To create successful campaigns, you need to take advantage of different messaging types: [push][3], [in-app messaging][4], [email][5] and [News Feed][6].  

## The Benefits of Multi-Channel Messaging

There are several benefits to mixing and matching push, in-app messages, email and the news feed:

- **You increase your reach.**  Some users don’t enable push, while others don’t check their email.  More channels equals a wider reach.

- **You retarget users.**  If a user was unresponsive toward a push message, sending another push with the same content may appear spammy.  Appboy’s features allow you to retarget users who didn’t open a message with a similar message in a different channel.

- **You have more flexibility with the content you share.**  While pushes are able to get a user’s attention, they can’t hold a lot of content.  News Feeds only exist within the app, but are rich with tailored content.  Why not combine the advantages of each? Pushes and in-app messages can act as teasers that [deep link][8] into your news feed.
