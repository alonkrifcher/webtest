# Understanding Your Users' Life Cycles

Because each user moves through your app and interacts with its features differently, your targeted messaging needs to be catered toward the individual journeys of your audience members. The first step to crafting effective, personal campaigns is to understand your users' life cycle. What are the various paths they can take through your app? What does that trajectory look like for active versus lapsing users? At what points of this journey do you need to send a campaign, in order to nudge users toward loyalty?

## Understanding the User Life Cycle

Appboy's guide on [Putting Users on the Path to Loyalty][1] teaches marketers how to map out the life-cycle roadmap for the four main types of users: loyal, active, lapsing and inactive. By understanding the steps different people take through your app and the direction you'd like them to move in, you can successfully guide your audience from instal to long haul.
