# Getting Started with Appboy

Check out our [Getting Started With Appboy guide][1] to learn about the different segmentation, campaign and customization features you'll be able to take advantage of one day, one week and one month after integrating. 

As soon as you begin using our platform, you will be able to create basic segments and campaigns. From this moment, Appboy begins collecting rich data on your users, allowing you to craft targeted messaging based on their behaviors, custom attributes and events, purchases and responses to messaging. 

As you continue to use Appboy, the user data you accumulate will power our platform's more sophisticated features. [Our guide][1] takes you through the steps of getting started so that you can master the basics and understand how Appboy's SDK grows with you.
