# Archiving Campaigns

If you'd like to stop a campaign from sending or clear it from your Dashboard, you can archive it. Go to the Campaigns page, click the gear icon next to the campaign's name and click "Archive":

![Archiving][1]

Archiving a campaign will accomplish the following:

- No further messages from that campaign will be delivered. In the case of in-app messages, no further in-app messages from that campaign will be displayed to users.
- The campaign's indicators will be removed from:
	- The Detailed Statistics graph on the App Usage page
	- The Detailed Statistics graph on the Revenue page
	- The Custom Events Over Time graph

You can also archive or unarchive multiple campaigns at once by checking the boxes next to the campaigns and then clicking the "Archive Selected" or "Unarchive Selected" buttons:

![Archive selected][3]

To view archived messages from the Campaigns page, check the box next to "Include archived campaigns":

![Include archived][2]

While clicking on an archived campaign will allow you to view its past results, you won't be able to edit the campaign. You will need to un-archive campaign in order to edit it.
