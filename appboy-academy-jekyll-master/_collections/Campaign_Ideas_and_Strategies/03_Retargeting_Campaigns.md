# Retargeting Campaigns

Appboy provides out of the box support for retargeting users based on the messaging they have received in the past. You can retarget users by creating segments of users who have already received a campaign or who have clicked a card in the news feed.

Each of these retargeting filters provides you with several options after you add them.

## Retargeting Filters

### Clicked/Opened Campaign Filter

## Why Use Retargeting Campaigns?

Retargeting is particularly effective when the original segment also included a specific action you want to see users take. For example, let's say you have a card targeted at users who have never made a purchase. The card advertises a promotion for a discounted in-app purchase. The initial segment looks like:

- Money Spent in App is exactly 0
- Last Used App less than 14 days ago

The total number of users in the segment is 100,000 and you know from the news feed stats that 60,000 unique users viewed the card and 20,000 unique users clicked the card. Through the segmenter we can see how many of those users who clicked the card actually made a purchase:

- Money Spent in App is more than 0
- Clicked Card is {Name of Card}

After examining those stats, we can make a segment of users who clicked the card, but did not make a purchase:

- Money Spent in App is exactly than 0
- Clicked Card is {Name of Card}

We can retarget this segment with additional messaging around the promotion or another in-app purchase. Retargeting can be done via another news feed card or through a messaging campaign. A multi-channel approach allows you to reach users where theyâ€™re most likely to respond, thus increasing the effectiveness of your campaigns.
