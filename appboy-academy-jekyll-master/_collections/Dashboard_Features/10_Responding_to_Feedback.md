# Responding to Feedback

Listening to User Feedback is important. It can alert you of a technical issue in your app or design flaws that you might not have considered. Most importantly though, it gives your users a way to reach out easily and directly to your app. If they have a criticism or face a technical issue, you need to make sure they come to you with that issue rather than dragging your name through the mud in the App Store, Google Play etc.

## Step 1: Managing Feedback

Feedback is organized within the dashboard by "Issues" and "Feedback." The latter are generic requests that may be critical or contain praise, while the former denote technical issues that require your immediate attention. You also may notice that you can keep multiple feedback tabs open at a time in order to efficiently manage your tickets.

## Step 2: Responding to Feedback

First, notice that you get the entire user card to the right of the feedback ticket. This enables you to see if this user has had frequent technical problems by clicking on the Feedback section while quickly gathering technical information from the user to promptly diagnose and fix bugs.

Responding to Feedback is as simple as typing a response in the text field, selecting one or two message types, and sending it off to the user.

In most cases, we recommend that you respond to the user via email, although reacting to positive Feedback via Twitter is often a great way to get free publicity. They might re-tweet you!

## Step 3: Following Up with All Users

In many cases, you might notice that a certain action or user behavior is causing a bug. Going back and segmenting users who might be experiencing similar issues can ensure that more than the small subset of users who actually take the time to complain feel truly supported.
