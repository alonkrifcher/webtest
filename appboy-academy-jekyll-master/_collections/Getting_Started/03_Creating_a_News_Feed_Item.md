# Creating a News Feed Item

Push Messages, Emails, and In-App messages are wonderful but ephemeral content. Once swiped away, you lose your opportunity to engage. If you catch a user at the wrong time, that message is lost to them forever. Multi-Channel messaging helps to ameliorate this problem, but the News Feed really puts it to rest once and for all.

News-Feed items allow you to insert permanent content directly into your app from our web dashboard. Better yet, the news feed also is targetable to individual segments just like all of our other message types. This means what you see in the feed might be completely different from another individual. The possibilities for the news-feed are nearly limitless.

To see examples of News Feeds, check out our [Client Integration Gallery][13].

## Step 1: Click Create Card

First you must choose the type of News Feed item you want to send down to your users. From the dropdown menu, you can select any of our four News Feed card types.

![News Feed Title Summary][6]

Time to compose your News Feed card! Create a title and summary for your card and upload an image to go alongside it. You can also set link behavior on this page. This link can be a standard link or a ["Deep Link"][7] to in-app content.

## Step 3: Select A Schedule

![News Feed Schedule][8]

Below the News Feed Card editor, you will find options for when to publish this item. You can choose to publish it immediately after creation or set a time in the future to publish it. You can also choose to deliver the News Feed card at a particular time in your users' local time by selecting the "Publish to Users in their Local Time Zone" checkbox.

## Step 4: Add an In-App Message

In-App Messages are a great way to notify your users of new News Feed content. Any time you publish a brand new card, you can send an In-App message along with it to maximize the visibility of its content. You can customize the In-App message to perform exactly like our normal In-App messages.

## Step 5: Select a Segment

You can configure your News Feed Card to target any [segment][10] you've defined within the dashboard at any schedule you desire. Select your target segment by clicking on the dropdown menu. Here you can see high-level statistics, including email availability and lifetime value per user.

## Step 6: Review Details and Publish

Next, you will be taken to a page that displays all of the details about your card (and companion In-App message, if applicable). You can review any of the details about these items and edit them if you need to by clicking the pencil icon in any of the headers.

That's it! You're done! You've published your first news-feed card!
