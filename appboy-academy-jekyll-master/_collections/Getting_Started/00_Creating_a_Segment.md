# Creating a Segment

Your developers have integrated the SDK, and the data from your users has begun pouring in. Now what? It's time to start segmenting your users.

Segmentation allows you to target users based upon their demographic, behavioral, social, or technical characteristics and actions. Creative and intelligent use of segmentation and messaging automation enables you to seamlessly and easily move your users from install to your KPIs.

In order to build a house, you have to lay the first brick. Let's create your first segment.

## Step 1: Navigating to the Segments Section

On the left-hand side under Engagement click on Segments.

## Step 2: Name Your Segment

Name your segment by describing the type of user you intend to filter for. This will ensure that this segment can easily and accurately be the target of multiple campaigns to come. Vague segment titles can cause confusion down the line.

## Step 3: Add Filters to your Segment

Add at least one filter to your segment as depicted in the image below. You can combine as many filters as you want in order to make your segmentation more specific.

Choosing "OR" for your filters means that your segment will contain users satisfying any combination of one, some, or all of those filters, while "AND" means that users who do not pass that filter will not be included in your segment. This logic can be combined, so that you can segment users who pass one filter "AND" either one of two other filters.

Notice that the statistics on your segment are changing in real time as you add and subtract filters. Keep in mind that these statistics are estimates (+/- 1%) and that the exact segment membership is always calculated before a segment is affected by a messaging campaign.

## Step 4: Save your Segment
