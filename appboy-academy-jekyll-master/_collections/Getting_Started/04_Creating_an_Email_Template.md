# Creating an Email Template

Email messages are great for delivering content to the user on their terms. They are also wonderful tools to re-engage users who may have even uninstalled your app! The Appboy dashboard has an email template editor that allows you to create custom-tailored, eye-catching emails and save them for later use in campaigns.

## Step 1: Navigate to the Email Template editor

You can access the Email Template editor by clicking the "Email Templates" button in the top right corner of the "Messaging" page in the dashboard.

## Step 2: Create a New Template

Click on the "New Template" button to begin editing a fresh new template.

## Step 3: Customize Your Template

Time to write your message! You can write right within the rich-text editor or optionally flip over to our HTML editor to customize content to your heart's content.

Appboy will add a footer with an unsubscribe link at the bottom of your email by default. If you would like to use your own footer, you can tick the "Suppress Footer" box.

If you want to see how your email looks before sending it out to your users, you can send a test email to an address of your choosing through the Settings tab in the top right corner.

## Step 4: Save Your Template

Be sure to save your template by clicking the "Save Template" button in the bottom right corner of the editor. You're now ready to use this template in any campaign you choose.

__Note:__ Be careful not to overwrite old email templates that are already in use by other campaigns or which may be used again!

__Note:__ To use your email template for an API campaign you will need the 'email_template_id', which can be retrieved from the bottom of any Email Template created within the dashboard. Below is an example of what this ID looks like:
