          <h3>What is Anxiety?</h3>
          
          <p> <small>Anxiety is a normal human reaction to feeling overwhelmed, stressed, and/or worried. There are a lot of factors in a college setting that make anxiety especially common: heavy workload, social status and interactions, and the career search, to name a few. But anxiety disorders are classified as mental illnesses and can become so overpowering that they make it impossible to live a normal life. </p></small>
          
          <p><small>These anxiety disorders include panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobias, and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Most of the time, these disorders manifest themselves in really physically crippling ways, even though they’re psychological. Treatment is important in managing these symptoms.</p></small>

<h4>Anxiety Disorders</h4>
<p><i><small><strong>Generalized Anxiety Disorder: </strong></i>The broadest of the anxiety illnesses, GAD consists of a constant and unrealistic sense of worry and distress, even if there isn’t any obvious cause for concern.</p></small>

<p><i><strong><small>Social Anxiety Disorder:</i></strong> Also known as social phobia, this is a serious illness represented by a real fear of and discomfort with social situations. People with social anxiety disorder often feel really self-conscious in these situations, worried about being judged by other people or acting in embarrassing ways.</p></small>

<p><i><small><strong>Phobias:</strong> </i>A phobia is an intense fear, generally of something specific. These can include anything from heights to snakes to trains. While most people are marginally afraid of lots of things, people with specific phobias may avoid everyday situations because of a disproportionate fear of some aspect of them.</p></small>

<p><i><small><strong>Panic Disorder:</strong> </i>A panic attack is a sudden, overwhelming sense of panic that often arrives without warning or specific purpose. Symptoms can include heart palpitations, sweating, difficulty breathing, and a feeling of “going crazy.” </p></small><br>

<h4> Mood Disorders </h4>
<p><small><i><strong>Seasonal Affective Disorder:</strong></i> Also known as seasonal depression, SAD generally affects someone at the same time every year, generally during the cold, dark winter months. It’s probably caused by hormonal changes and starts around young adulthood.</p></small>

<p><small><i><strong>Dysthymic Disorder: </strong></i>This is a less severe type of depression, but it still causes a chronic feeling of sadness for at least two years. A family history of mood disorders is often a factor and is more common in women than men. Dysthymic disorder can happen on its own or in conjunction with other psychiatric disorders. Up to 5% of the population suffers from this disorder. </p></small>

<p><small><i><strong>Major/Clinical Depression:</strong></i> Marked by a depressed mood most of the day, especially in the morning, and loss of interest in normal activities and relationships. Symptoms are present every day for at least two weeks, and often multiple years. Major depression affects about 6.7% of the US adult population, and will affect around 25% of adults at some point in their lifetimes. </p></small>

<p><i><small><strong>Bipolar Disorder: </strong></i> Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder in which one’s mood swings between periods of depression and mania. A swing into depression from a manic state is particularly dangerous for those suffering from bipolar disorder. These elevated or depressed moods can last for short or extremely long periods of time and generally result in poor decision-making.</p></small>

             <h3>What is Psychosis?</h3>
<p><small>Illnesses involving psychosis are conditions affecting the brain’s ability to think clearly, make good decisions, communicate, behave appropriately, and understand reality. While they’re very serious, even the most severe psychotic disorders can be treated effectively. Symptoms vary greatly between individuals, but psychosis is marked by hallucinations (unusual sensory perceptions of things that aren’t present) and delusions (persistent false beliefs that don’t go away even after receiving truthful information). Psychotic disorders usually become apparent in one’s 20s or 30s. </p>

<h4> Psychotic Disorders </h4>
<p><small><i><strong>Brief Psychotic Disorder:</strong></i> People with this disorder exhibit quick bouts of psychotic behavior as a result of very stressful events, such as the death of a loved one. Recovery is often fast.</i></p></small>

<p><small><i><strong>Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder: </strong></i>This can occur when the use of or withdrawal from certain substances, such as heroin or crack cocaine, causes hallucinations or delusions. </p></small>

<p><small><i><strong>Delusional Disorder:</i> </strong>People with this illness have a delusion involving real-life situations that could be true, such as having a disease or being followed. The delusions last for at least a month and can be very damaging both to the individual and to those around him or her.</p></small>

<p><small><i><strong>Schizoaffective Disorder:</i> </strong>People with this disorder have symptoms of both schizophrenia and a mood disorder, such as depression or bipolar disorder.</p></small>

<p><i><small><strong>Schizophrenia:</i></strong> Schizophrenia manifests itself in many ways, but is marked by hallucinations, delusions, and other changes in behavior that last longer than six months. These are usually accompanied by a decline in work, school, and social functioning.</p></small>

          <p> <small>Personality disorders are mental disorders that can cause someone to think, function, and behave differently than the social norm. This can seriously affect their ability to socialize and participate in society, even with regards to day-to-day skills. Some disorders cause a disconnect between thoughts, memories, and actions, while others manifest themselves much more mildly and may create challenges without ever being diagnosed. Not all symptoms have to be present.  </p></small>
